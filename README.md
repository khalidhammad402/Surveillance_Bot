Surveillance Bot

The purpose of the robot is to move around in an area and transmit live video information which the user can see on the user screen. 
The Surveillance Robot is based on combination of IoT and Robotics.

I have used node MCU in this bot which has inbuilt WIFI capabilities, which helps the bot to communicate with the user (receive and send data). I have used my phone’s camera for getting live video stream.

For controlling the Bot, I designed a webpage which is hosted by node MCU, it contains control panel of the BOT and live video stream.  The robot can be easily controlled using keyboard keys W (forward), S (backward), A(left), D(right).

Currently the robot can be controlled only on a local server, but with further improvements, We can control the robot remotely from anywhere in the world.
